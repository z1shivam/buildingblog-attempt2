I am still working on UI. Yes, this is quite a progress but I would like to go to my next attempt; 
Why so?

I am working on how to write maintainable code and I am exploring more and more. I just discovered, instead of hard coding text everywhere, I can just use something called a siteconfig.ts where i will export data for this site which I can use everywhere. This is so simple yet I have never thought of this before. I am going to impliment this on my attempt 3.
